after importing the "geolocate.py" file into your computer
open the file into vscode or any type of platform you use 
too open a source code. then change "<phone_number>" into
 your phone number that you want too geolocate. then you can 
run the file and it will create a new file named "mylocation.html"
open the "mylocation.html" and you will see a map where the phone number location is.

wish this will be helpfull. and also this is not really specific
. it just shows the country of the phone number.
